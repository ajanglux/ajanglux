<h3 align="left">What is a real-time chat-app? </h3>
<p align="left">A real-time chat app is a software application that enables users to communicate with each other in real-time over the internet. It allows for instantaneous exchange of text messages, multimedia content, or other forms of communication. Real-time chat apps are widely used for personal, business, and social purposes.</p>

<h3 align="right">What is Python? </h3>
<p align="right">Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<h3 align="left">What is Sockets? </h3>
<p align="left">Sockets provide a programming interface for network communication in most modern computer systems. A socket is a low-level communication endpoint that can be used for sending and receiving data over a network. Sockets can be used for communication between processes on the same machine or between processes on different machines across a network.</p>
